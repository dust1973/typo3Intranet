General
-------

The only mandatory field is the configuration name. This is only to name the records you have just created.

.. tip::
	Please note that you may create multiple configuration records with the same (or another) LDAP server. It may then
	be useful to restrict a given LDAP configuration to be used to one or more domains. In case the list of associated
	domains is left empty, then the corresponding configuration will be valid for *any* domain.
