Administrator manual

	This chapter describes how to manage the extension from an administrator point of view.


First step for configuring your LDAP authentication is to create one or more server configuration records. To do this,
use module Web > List and create a record "Configuration LDAP / SSO" on the root level of your TYPO3 website (pid 0):

.. figure:: ../Images/new-record.png
	:alt: Creating a record "Configuration LDAP / SSO"

	When creating a new record at the root of your website, choose "Configuration LDAP / SSO".

The form to edit such a record is split in 6 tabs that we will describe separately in the next few sections.
