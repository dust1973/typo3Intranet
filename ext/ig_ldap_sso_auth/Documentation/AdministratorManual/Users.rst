FE_USERS and BE_USERS
---------------------

The third and fifth tab can be filled exactly the same way. The only difference between them is that FE_USERS stores the
configuration options for the frontend LDAP user authentication and BE_USERS stores the configuration options for the
backend LDAP user authentication.

You may only fill the sections you need; that is, FE_USERS if you need frontend authentication and BE_USERS if you need
backend authentication.

Base DN
^^^^^^^

Full DN path of the directory containing all the users that you want to use with your TYPO3 authentification.

**Example:**

::

	ou=people,dc=example,dc=com


.. _admin-manual-feusers-filter:
.. _admin-manual-beusers-filter:

Filter
^^^^^^

Filter is used to precise which LDAP attribute contains the username of your users and which filter to apply when
selecting users to import, either from the backend module or from the Scheduler task.

Example: ``(uid={USERNAME})`` uid is the most common attribute used to keep the username in LDAP but if you are in
Active Directory, the field where the username is stored is usually ``sAMAccountName`` instead.

You will also be able to add restrictions that allow you to exclude user from specific properties. The syntax used in
this field is the standard LDAP search syntax.

**Example:**

::

	(&(uid={USERNAME})(objectClass=posixAccount))

.. note::
	The string ``{USERNAME}`` will be substituted by the username entered in the login form. In case the filter is
	used in the context of importing users, any placeholder will be replaced by an asterisk, thus effectively returning
	any record matching the filter.


.. _admin-manual-feusers-mapping:
.. _admin-manual-beusers-mapping:

Mapping
^^^^^^^

The mapping is used to fetch other attributes from the LDAP server that we would like users to have. It is quite simple,
each line is a new command. Each command has two parts separated by a ``=`` (equal sign). the first part is the field
from the TYPO3 user that we want to fill and the second part is the value that the field will have.

There are three possible value types you may use:

- a string;
- a LDAP attribute value;
- a custom marker;

.. Cross-linking does not seem to work when rendering as PDF, at least locally with EXT:sphinx

.. only:: html

	In addition, every field supports :ref:`t3tsref:stdWrap` properties. Multi-valued LDAP attributes are available
	using ``field`` where values have been joined together using a line-feed character (``\n``).

.. only:: latex

	In addition, every field supports stdWrap properties. Multi-valued LDAP attributes are available
	using ``field`` where values have been joined together using a line-feed character (``\n``).

.. warning::
	LDAP field names are always lowercase when accessed in TypoScript.


.. _admin-manual-feusers-mapping-string:
.. _admin-manual-beusers-mapping-string:

String
""""""

This will assign the value directly to the field

**Example:**

::

	email = user@domain.com


.. _admin-manual-feusers-mapping-ldapattribute:
.. _admin-manual-beusers-mapping-ldapattribute:

LDAP attribute
""""""""""""""

LDAP attributes will be recognized by the specific characters ``<>``.

**Example:**

::

	email = <mail>


This will set the field email of the TYPO3 user to the value of the attribute ``mail`` of the user fetched from the LDAP
server.


.. _admin-manual-feusers-mapping-custommarker:
.. _admin-manual-beusers-mapping-custommarker:

Custom marker
"""""""""""""

Custom markers are markers created by the extension to assign specific type of values. There are only four types of
markers available at the moment:

- ``{DATE}``: the current timestamp;

- ``{RAND}``: a random number;

- ``{USERNAME}``: the username from the login form (the username will automatically fill the needed field. This marker
  is only used if you want to put the username in another field than the one by default);

- ``{hook parameters}``: will only be useful if an extension
  :ref:`hooks into ig_ldap_sso_auth <development-extramergefield>`.

Examples

**BE_USERS**

::

	tstamp = {DATE}
	email = <mail>
	realName = <cn>
	lang = fr

**FE_USERS**

::

	pid = 45
	tstamp = {DATE}
	email = <mail>
	name = <cn>
	first_name = <givenName>
	last_name = <sn>
	title = <title>
	address = <street>
	zip = <postalCode>
	city = <l>
	telephone = <telephoneNumber>

.. tip::
	You may combine multiple markers as well, e.g., ::

		name = <sn>, <givenName>

**TypoScript**

::

	name = <cn>
	name.wrap = |-LDAP

	telephone {
	    field = telephonenumber
	    split {
	        token.char = 10
	        cObjNum = 1
	        1.current = 1
	        1.noTrimWrap = ||, |
	    }
	    substring = 0,-2
	}
