.. _faq-users:

Users
-----

.. question

**Is it possible to have both users manually defined (thus authenticated with a TYPO3 password) and users authenticated
with LDAP?**

.. answer

*Yes. Both for frontend and backend authentication it is possible to manually define users unrelated to your LDAP
server(s). When a user is manually defined, the record's column* ``tx_igldapssoauth_dn`` *is empty and thus, since the
LDAP authentication will fail, it will automatically fall back to the standard TYPO3 authentication service. This
behaviour may be enabled/disabled globally for backend and/or frontend within Extension Manager.*

-------

.. question

**I have a local user with the same username as a LDAP user but which has been manually created in TYPO3. Which password
will be taken into account?**

.. answer

*When you manually create a user in TYPO3, it is not related to LDAP. This local user may authenticate with the
password you set. However is the user matches a LDAP user* **and the password provided** *results into a successful
LDAP authentication, the manually created user will be automatically linked to the LDAP user.* **Afterwards, only
the LDAP password will be valid**.

-------

.. question

**I would like to silently and automatically authenticate my users in frontend (Single Sign On / SSO). Since Apache is
configured to restrict access using** :term:`Kerberos`, **no login form should be needed in my website. Is this possible
with this extension?**

.. answer

*Yes. You have to activate this option in Extension Manager and ensure you have properly configured mod_ntlm or
Kerberos with Apache (or any other supported web server). This extension will look for a username
in* ``$_SERVER['REMOTE_USER']`` *(without any domain part) to silently create the session in TYPO3.*

-------


.. _faq-groups:

Groups
------

.. question

**Can I import user groups automatically?**

.. answer

*Yes you can.*

-------

.. question

**May I manually tweak the name or configuration of imported user groups?**

.. answer

*Yes. To do so, you should enable the global option in Extension Manager preventing the automatic synchronization of
groups (may be configured separately for backend and frontend). In order to import new groups manually, use the LDAP /
SSO backend module. Once imported, you may change their name to fit your needs and conventions.*

-------

.. question

**My server is providing a hierarchy of groups. Is it possible to automatically mirror this structure in TYPO3?**

.. answer

*Yes. You should provide a be_groups and/or fe_groups mapping instruction for the LDAP attribute holding the reference
to the parent group. E.g.,* ::

	parentGroup = <memberOf>

-------

.. question

**Which servers support the "memberOf" / "groupMembership" attribute?**

.. answer

*Windows 2000 and above Active Directory and Novell eDirectory definitely support this attribute.*

-------

.. question

**My infrastructure provides 2 LDAP servers, one containing group records, the second containing only users but with
"memberOf" attributes corresponding to groups found on the other server. Is it possible to map those groups to the
users?**

.. answer

*Yes. In order to do that, you will need to manually import the LDAP user groups into your TYPO3 website and then
configure the global option in Extension Manager that disables the synchronization of user groups. This way, only the
configured baseDN for groups will be compared with the groups assigned as "memberOf" attributes, without actively
retrieving corresponding group records from the LDAP server.*

-------


.. _faq-security:

Security
--------

.. question

**Is the effective user's password ever stored in TYPO3?**

.. answer

*No. The password provided in the login form is sent directly to the LDAP server and never stored in TYPO3. However,
since TYPO3 requires a password to be set for frontend and backend user records, this extension generates and saves
a random 16 byte password for the sole purpose of making TYPO3 happy.*

-------

.. question

**Can I encrypt my connection to the LDAP server?**

.. answer

*Yes. This extension is supporting SSL-encrypted connection to the LDAP server as well as TLS-based connection.*

-------

.. question

**Which port number is my LDAP server listening on?**

.. answer

*It is not possible to answer without knowing your infrastructure but it is worth to mention that*

- **389** *is the industry standard port for LDAP connections over TCP/IP, and*
- **636** *is the industry standard port for LDAP connections over SSL.*

-------


.. _faq-migration:

Migration
---------

.. question

**I am currently using another LDAP extension to authenticate my users, namely** :ter:`eu_ldap`. **Does this extension
at least provide the same feature set?**

.. answer

*Yes. And in order to ease the migration, this extension is able to migrate your legacy eu_ldap configuration records
to be compatible with ig_ldap_sso_auth using the "UPDATE!" script in Extension Manager (EM). You should first configure
global options for ig_ldap_sso_auth in EM and only then migrate your legacy eu_ldap configuration records. This will
ensure possible configuration issues to be detected.*

.. hint::
	The migration wizard does not require extension eu_ldap to be **loaded** but only expects the corresponding
	database table to be present.
