Introduction
============

.. _what-it-does:

What does it do?
----------------

This extension enables import/update/deletion of users and groups (frontend, backend or both) from a LDAP-directory and
provides Single Sign-On (:term:`SSO`) for frontend users. These features make it the perfect choice when deploying TYPO3
as an intranet CMS.

In case the network topology makes it useful, this extension is able to work with multiple LDAP server configurations,
with a priority order based on the manual sorting of configuration records.

This extension is known to work with OpenLDAP, Active Directory (various versions) and Novell eDirectory.

Please consult the :ref:`faq` for additional information.

*Causal Sàrl*, a Swiss company actively contributing to TYPO3, has taken over this extension which has been initially
developed by *Infoglobe*, a Canadian company specialized in open-source software.

We would like to thank:

- Support for TYPO3 6.2 LTS and some further enhancements have been sponsored by the *Centre électronique de gestion
  (CEG)*, technically the IT department of the Swiss city Neuchâtel.
- Full user import was sponsored by the *Ecole d'Etudes Sociales et Pédagogiques*, in Lausanne, Switzerland.
