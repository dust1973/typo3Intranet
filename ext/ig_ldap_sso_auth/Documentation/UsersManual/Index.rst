	This chapter describes how to use the extension from a user point of view.


When a user tries to log on, the extension passes her credentials to the LDAP server(s) and verifies them. When a LDAP
server can authenticate the user, she is logged on. New users (in the directory but not in the TYPO3 database) are
imported after authentication. Records of existing users are updated.

In addition, imported users from the directory automatically get a random password for their counterpart record in
TYPO3, preventing them from bypassing the LDAP authentication.

In case Single Sign-On (:term:`SSO`) has been activated, the typical login form is made useless and users within your
domain will be automatically authenticated.
