  "description": "This extension provides LDAP support for TYPO3 by delegating the authentication of frontend and/or backend users to the centrally-managed directory of your organization. It fully supports OpenLDAP, Active Directory and Novell eDirectory and is capable of connecting securely to the authentication server using either TLS or SSL (ldaps://). In case of use in an intranet environment, this extension is a perfect match since it natively brings Single Sign-On (SSO) capability to TYPO3 without any complex configuration.",
